2. No information about target provided
3. Viewer enters altered state (Focus 10-15)
4. Sketches impressions and describes sensory data
5. Results kept secret from viewer (maintain confidence)
6. Validated against actual target location

**Frequency Protocols Used:**
- **Focus 10-15:** Target acquisition and initial perception
- **Beta waves (15-20 Hz):** Active remote viewing sessions
- **Theta waves (4-8 Hz):** Deep information access

### Declassification & Review (1995)

**American Institutes for Research (AIR) Review:**

**Findings:**
- "Statistically significant effect has been observed in laboratory"
- Information provided was "vague and ambiguous"
- "Difficult, if not impossible" to yield actionable intelligence
- Recommended termination of program

**However:**
- Dale Graff (investigator) expressed surprise at "failure" designation
- Noted military never took it seriously enough for action
- Joseph McMoneagle maintains program had operational successes
- CIA published full records in CREST archive (January 2017)

### Documented Successes

**Operational Missions:**
- Soviet submarine location (1979)
- Lost spy plane recovery (1976)
- Multiple classified intelligence operations
- McMoneagle: "Never had a mission until all other methods exhausted"

**Laboratory Results:**

### Why Program Was Terminated

**Official Reasons:**
1. Lack of actionable intelligence for operations
2. Information too vague for decision-making
3. Concerns about inter-judge reliability
4. Limited applicability to real intelligence gathering

**Unofficial Perspective:**
- Military skepticism prevented operational use
- Budget pressures during post-Cold War period
- Political factors in intelligence community
- Success rate sufficient for research, not operations

### Legacy & Modern Continuation

**Public Impact:**
- Featured in "The Men Who Stare at Goats" (2004 book, 2009 film)
- Spawned civilian remote viewing training programs
- Thousands trained in CRV methodology
- Active remote viewing community worldwide

- Perception from external vantage point
- Sense of floating or flying
- Often includes viewing one's own body from above

**Prevalence:**
- **10% of population** experiences spontaneous OBEs
- **25% report at least one in lifetime**
- Training can increase probability **5-10x**

### Neuroscience Research

#### 2014 University of Ottawa Study

**Citation:** De Ridder et al., "Neural correlates of out-of-body experiences"

**Method:**
- fMRI brain mapping during OBEs
- Recruited individual who can induce OBEs at will
- Compared brain activity: normal vs. OBE state

**Key Finding:**

- REM-sleep boundary period
- Natural cortisol rise begins

**Brainwave State:**
- **Theta frequency (4-8 Hz)** most conducive
- Transition between sleep and wake
- Hypnagogic/hypnopompic states
- Reduced frontal lobe activity

**Technique Requirements:**
- Body completely relaxed (Focus 10: "Mind Awake/Body Asleep")
- Awareness maintained while body sleeps
- Vibrational state often reported
- Intention and practice essential

### Monroe Institute OBE Protocol

**Training Progression:**

**Phase 1: Focus 10 (Weeks 1-2)**
